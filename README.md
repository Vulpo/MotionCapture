One software for Arduino Uno, one software for Unity4. The Hardware directory holds a scheme of the hardware.
The aim is to collect rotation values from two Inertial Measurement Units from the arduino and send it via Xbee to the computer to feed the movement of an articulated arm in Unity.

READMEs in Arduino, Unity and Hardware Folders give more precisions about the projects.
